Sudoku is a classic puzzle game that i love where every row, column and 3x3 box needs to have a distinct 1-9 number. I coded a Solver for it during class.

Sudoku-X follows all the rules of regular Sudoku, but also restricts the 2 main diagonals.
No two of the same numbers can be on the same main diagonal.
